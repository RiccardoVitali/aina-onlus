  <h2>3 - Specification</h2>

  <h3>3.1 - Web Architecture</h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and
      how they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer,
      data layer or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not
      rendered server side?
    </p> -->
  <p>
    The database is the data layer, while the Application server
    serves as application layer. The database is the one managed through Heroku,
    while the Application Server is the one generated from the swaggerUI.
    In a basic representation:
  </p>
  <div><img src="img/backend_structure.png" width="700px" /></div>
  <p>
    The initial response will be large and serve the static files including
    all CSS, all Javascript, all HTML pages and some images, but no real
    content. The future requests will serve JSON with information from the
    database that will fill the appropriate HTML pages.
  </p>

  <h3>3.2 - API</h3>
  <h4>3.2.1 - REST compliance
  </h4>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
      the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
      not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.
    </p> -->
  <p>
    We'll describe our approach to REST principles by targeting their main
    points, explaining if and why we followed those principles.<br>

    <ul>

      <li>
        Uniform Interface: this is fundamental to the REST API design and we
        did our best to follow this principle. Our interface is resource based
        and we use HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State).
        All the resources are accessible through a HTTP GET request.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Client-Server: Client and server can be developed independently and
        evolve separately with no dependency from each other.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Stateless: Interaction between client and server is stateless, unless a user logs in.
        The server does not store any information about the previous requests and
        it is able to properly respond to one request only by checking it.
        The server does not need any history of received requests.
        If a user logs in, the request from the client contains all the information necessary to satisfy
        the request, including authentication and authorization details.
      </li><br>

      <li>
        Application Architecture: the application architecture is layered. Three main layers are available in the application: presentation, application and data.
        Each layer can interact only with the following one, in order to split responsibility among them and assigning a specific focus to each layer.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <h3>3.3 - Data model</h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
      application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
    </p> -->
  <p>
    The relationship between entities is the following:
    a person can work for several services and can organize numerous events,
    but each person has only one main service (each person works mainly on one service).
    People related to a person are those who work for the main service
    of the person. <br>
    An event can support only one service but a service can be supported by
    many events. </p>
    <p>


    We have assigned an unique ID number to each person and to each service. This allows us to define
    in a single event who the organizer is and which service the event is supporting through the use of IDs.
    <br>
    In order to manage the relationship between people and services
    we created a specific table. Each row of this table is formed by
    the person's ID and the service's ID. </p>
    <p>Tables are linked in a suitable way in order to avoid future mistakes:
    person's ID and service's ID, in the events' table, are directly linked
    to their respectively tables, in this way an event can be created only
    if it is attached to an existing person and service, and if we delete a person, or
    a service, all the events linked to them will be deleted as consequence.
    If a service is eliminated, nothing happens. </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, in the table of the relationship between people and services,
    if we delete a specific relation nothing happens, but if we delete
    a service, or a person, all the relationships related to it will
    be eliminated. Moreover, it's impossible to create a relationship
    between a person and a service if one of the two IDs does not correspond
    to an already existing person or service, and this holds also for
    the main service's id in the person's table.<br>
    The user table stores all the users that have created an account: it is not
    possible to sign up a user with a username that is already used.
    The newsletter table keeps track of the email of who is registered to the
    association's newsletter. It is not possible to register the same email twice.<br>
    The contact form table is used to store all the messages, and the associated email,
    that are sent to the association through the page Contact us.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>4 - Implementation</h2>
  <h3>4.1 - Tools used</h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the
      backend of the application.
    </p> -->
  The backend of the application was entirely created with NodeJS. The server framework Express has been used to create the server.
  The skeleton has been generated by Swagger with Generate Server button in the Swagger editor.
  Then, with the help of knex module, the Postgres database has been connected to the server.
  </p>
  <h3>4.2 - Discussion
  </h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      - How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
      OpenAPI specification?
    </p> -->
  <p>
    We started from OpenAPI specifications to start building the application.
    During the process, Swagger helped in the control of the APIs specified with OpenAPI editor.
    It validates the requests made by the client checking if they respect the specification described in the yaml file.
    The resposes of GET requests reflect the structure of database entities.
    We tested the operations via
    <a href="https://afronlus.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui">SwaggerUI</a>.
    However, requests from newsletter, contact-form and signup are not shown in SwaggerUI.
  </p>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      - Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
      partition the web application (static assets vs. application data)
    </p> -->
  <p>
    To comply with REST specification, we divided static contents from data needed to fill the page sections.
    The data is fetched via specific calls from the client, then it is retrieved and executed in the client browser
    that makes a request to the server and waits a response to fill the page with the received data.

  </p>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      - Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what
      are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).
    </p> -->
  <p>
    We used cookie-session and cookie-parser for the session state.
    As soon as the user registers, his data is stored in the database,
    and when a user logs in, a new session is generated, contening
    all the information about him, in this way he can navigate the website
    remaining logged in, until he logs out thus destroying that session.
  </p>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      - Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for
      managing the data model?
    </p> -->
  Postgres, an object-relational database has been used for the data layer.
  The database queries have been managed with knex node module.
  <h2>5 - Other information</h2>
  <h3>5.1 - Task assignment</h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of
      the group

  <h3>5.2 - Analysis of existing API</h3>
  <!--     <p
      question="Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI
    specification and why (at least two)."
    ></p> -->
  <p>
    We were inspired by this simple and practical example:
    <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/">Swagger Petstore</a>, moreover
    we explored the swagger documentation and we watched several swagger tutorials
    on youtube.<br>
    Professor Zaccaria's lessons helped us a lot, providing the necessary
    information to get acquainted with the OpenAPI specification.
  </p>
  <h3>5.4 - Learning outcome</h3>
  <!--     <p class="question">
      What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
      developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
      how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
    </p> -->
  <p>
    - Riccardo Vitali had never seen a javascript code before in his life and he
    had never worked with databases or websites, so he had to learn everything
    from scratch, the effort was great but,
    thanks to Professor Zaccaria's lectures, the many videos on youtube and
    the posts on stackoverflow, he slowly became familiar with the environment.
    Additionally, he got a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS and he learnt how
    to use github and a platform such as Heroku.
  </p>
    <p>
      - Federico Pozzi comes from Design school, he had the chance to improve his coding skills, particularly css, html and javascript, becoming able to build from scratch a full website.
      Moreover he got aware of the functionality of a database and SQL, by discovering how the architecture is made and how It works. He thinks that all the knowledge he learned in this course will be a solid base for his future.
    </p>
    <p>
      - Andrea Silvano has learned the basics of Database and how to link a DB to the frontend. Currently enrolled in the Master's Degree in Communication Design thanks to Hypermedia application is now able to develop static webpages with ease and
      furthermore implementing some notions of basic database in the webpage. Thanks to this course he's now able to fluently work with HTML, CSS, JS and DB entries.
