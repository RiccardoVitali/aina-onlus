    <h2>Specification</h2>

    <h3>Web Architecture</h3>
    <p class="question">
      Describe here, with a diagram, the components of your web application and
      how they interact. Highlight which parts belong to the application layer,
      data layer or presentation layer. How did you ensure that HTML is not
      rendered server side?
    </p>
    <div><img src="img/WebArchitecture.png" width="700px" /></div>
    <p>
      The initial response will be large and serve the static files including
      all CSS, all Javascript, some images and a HTML page containing a header,
      a footer and a container, but no real content. The future requests will
      only serve JSON with information from the database. The JS will generate
      the appropriate HTML with the data in the response JSON as content.
    </p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <h4>REST compliance       -----------------------DA FARE
</h4>
    <p class="question">
      Describe here to what extent did you follow REST principles and what are
      the reasons for which you might have decided to diverge. Note, you must
      not describe the whole API here, just the design decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rest API could be considered to be of maturity level 2. Level 1: It
      take advantage of resources, where every resource has it own URI: Level 2:
      It takes advantage HTTP verbs, status codes, and query parameters is used.
      Level 3: No Hateoas is implemented, the responses don’t include any links.
      The reason why Level 3 is not implemented was to make the implementation
      simpler, since I don’t have any previous experience with it and wanted to
      focus on other parts.
    </p>
    <h4>OpenAPI Resource models</h4>

    <h3>Data model</h3>
    <p class="question">
      Describe with an ER diagram the model used in the data layer of your web
      application. How these map to the OpenAPI data model?
    </p>
    The relationship between entities is the following:
    a person can work for several services and can organize numerous events,
    but each person has a main service (each person works mainly on one service).
    People related to a person are those who work for the main service
    of the person. <br>
    An event can support only one service but a service can be supported by
    many events. <br>
    The person's id and the service's id, in the single event table, assign to a
    single event who is the organizer and which service it supports by means
    of ids. <br>
    In order to manage the relationship between people and services
    we have created a specific table. Each row of this table is formed by
    the person's id and the service's id. <br>
    The newsletter table takes track of the email of who is registered to the
    association's newsletter. <br>
    Tables are linked in a suitable way in order to avoid future mistakes:
    person's id and service's id in the events' table are directly linked
    to their respectively tables, in this way an event can be attached
    only to an existing person or service, and if we delete a person, or
    a service, all the events linked to them will be deleted as consequence.
    Instead, if we delete an event, nothing happens. Moreover, since a service 
    can support only one event, we have made impossible to create an event supported
    by a service that already supports an existing event, by a 'unique' constraint.

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <h3>Tools used</h3>
    <p class="question">
      Describe here which tools, languages and frameworks did you use for the
      backend of the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend of the application has been implemented with NodeJS, where the
      server framework Express has been used to created the server. For the data
      storage Postgres has been used.
    </p>
    <h3>Discussion       -----------------------DA FARE
</h3>
    <p class="question">
      - How did you make sure your web application adheres to the provided
      OpenAPI specification?
    </p>
    <p>
      By documenting all the routes in the web application and testing the
      operations via
      <a
        href="https://afronlus.herokuapp.com/backend/swaggerui"
        >SwaggerUI</a
      >. However, login with example user works but future request will not
      include session id and therefore routes that need authentication will not
      be allowed from SwaggerUI. The reason for this is that "...for Swagger UI
      and Swagger Editor Cookie authentication is currently not supported for
      "try it out" requests due to browser security restrictions."
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      - Why do you think your web application adheres to common practices to
      partition the web application (static assets vs. application data)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Node module serve-static is used to serve a folder named Public
      containing static assets when the root of the application is requested.
      While the application data, in this case as JSON, will be served when the
      different routes are accessed with the help of Express Routing middleware.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      - Describe synthetically why and how did you manage session state, what
      are the state change triggering actions (e.g., POST to login etc..).
    </p>
    <p>
      The application is using express-session to help to manage session. In
      this version of the default server-side session storage, MemoryStore is
      used. This is not something that should be in a real production since it
      will often leak memory and scale badly. The reason why I have used it is
      easier to manage during development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three actions exists to change session state: <br />
      POST to /user/signup with username and password in body: will create new
      session if username is not taken.
      <br />
      POST to /user/login with username and password: will create new session if
      username and password match.
      <br />
      POST to /user/logut with session in header: will destroy the session
      provided in the header.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      - Which technology did you use (relational or a no-SQL database) for
      managing the data model?
    </p>
    <p>I have been using a relational database, Postgres</p>
    <h2>Other information</h2>
    <h3>Task assignment</h3>
    <p class="question">
      Describe here how development tasks have been subdivided among members of
      the group
    </p>
    <p>Riccardo Vitali took care of the backend part, while
    Federico Pozzi and Andrea Silvano worked on the frontend.</p>
    <h3>Analysis of existing API</h3>
    <p
      question="Describe here if you have found relevant APIs that have inspired the OpenAPI
    specification and why (at least two)."
    ></p>
    <p>
      I was inspired by this simple and practical example:
      <a href="https://petstore.swagger.io/">Swagger Petstore</a>, moreover
      I explored the swagger documentation and I watched several swagger tutorials
      on youtube.
      Professor Zaccaria's lessons helped me a lot, providing me the necessary
      information to get acquainted with the OpenAPI specification.
    </p>
    <h3>Learning outcome</h3>
    <p class="question">
      What was the most important thing all the members have learned while
      developing this part of the project, what questions remained unanswered,
      how you will use what you've learned in your everyday life?
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd never seen a javascript code before in my life and I'd never worked
      with databases or websites.
      So I had to learn everything from scratch, the effort was great but,
      between Professor Zaccaria's lectures and the many videos on youtube and
      posts on stackoverflow I slowly became familiar with the environment.
